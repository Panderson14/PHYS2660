# PHYS2660

This class was by far my favorite class of first year. In this class, we learned how to program in C to solve complex physics problems. Many of these problems were similar to what I saw in my Intro Physics class the previous semester, and to be able to solve them computationally was incredibly satisfying. The class culminated in a take home final exam that had some very difficult questions that were nonetheless very interesting.

Unfortunately, this was back when I had never used GitHub before, and would just save all of my code in a pdf document that I could look at and copy code from. Not the best form of bookkeeping in the slightest, but at least I was lucky enough to have all of my code saved to one place so I could upload it now.
